Exercise 48 -1 point Missing Tentative list
Extra Credit: 1 point  (d) goes to G
POINTS EARNED:  9/10 points
EC: 1/2

Read chapters 1, 3 and 5 from Computer Networks, Peterson and Davie 5th ed.

Chapter 3 questions:

1) Exercise 13
2) Exercise 15
3) Exercise 41
4) Exercise 46
5) Exercise 48
6) Exercise 55
  
Extra Credit:
7) Exercise 72

1) We choose the shortest path to the root, in case of same length, we choose the lower number ID. The root is the lowest, B1. Thus we exclude: B2 - A , B5 - B, B5 - F , B6 - I

2) When A sends to C B4 does not learn with A is, the same applying from C to A. As from sending to C from D, all bridges acknowledge the package and the location of D. 

Forwarding Table for B1: 

Destination Next location
A           A
C           B2 
D           B2 

for B2: 
Destination Next location
A           B1
C           B3
D           B4
for B3:
Destination Next location
C           C
D           B2
for B4:
Destination Next Location
A           B2
D           D

3) IPv4 requires that if we need to do resseambly we do it at the endrouter rather than at the next one because the fragments initially occurred due to size constraints. That is, if we reassemble at the next one, B, but our destination is C, might as well just send fragments all the way and just reassemble once.

IPv6 ditched fragmentation because by the time this was made we already have reference values for MTUs, that is the maximum transmission unit, and since MTU is mandatory then the sender already knows beforehand what his size constraint is to avoid fragments.

5) Format (Distance, Origin)
Step
1   D(0,-)
2   D(0,-)
3   D(0,-), E(2,D)
4   D(0,-), E(2,D), C(3,D)
5   D(0,-), E(2,D), C(3,D), B(4,E)

7   D(0,-), E(2,D), C(3,D), B(4,D), A(6,D), F(9,D)

6)
a) Applying the subnet mask 255.255.255.128 we get 128.96.39.0 use interface 0
b)  Applying the subnet mask 255.255.255.128 we get 128.96.40.0 use interfaceR2
c) Applying the subnet mask 255.255.255.128 we don't get a match so it defaults and goes to R4
d) Applying the subnet mask 255.255.255.192 we get 192.4.153.0 so R3
e) Defaults again as no entries match and goes to R4

7) 

a) Goes to B matches C4.50.0.0/12
b) Goes to A matches C4.5E.10.0/20 
c) goes to E 80.0.0.0/1
d) goes to F 40.0.0.0/2
e) goes to C C4.60.0.0/12
f) goes to D C4.68.0.0/14
