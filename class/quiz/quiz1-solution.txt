* Copy this file to your own quiz folder. 
* Do not modify anything in the quiz folder, else subversion will stop your commits! 
* Put your name where it says "Name".


The three files m.c, s.c and s.h have been provided for you in a subdirectory
called q1-files. 

1) Write a Makefile with these targets:

   * m -     This target creates executable m from sources m.c, s.h and compiled s.o.
             It builds s.o if necessary.
   * s.o -   This target creates compiled s.o from sources s.c and s.h.
   * run -   This target runs ./m 83. It builds m if necessary.
   * clean - This target rm's all build products.

Target run is the default target.

All dependencies must work. For instance:

   * "touch s.o" should rebuild m on either make m or make run.
   * "touch s.c" should rebuild s.o and m on any of - make m, make s.o or make run.
   * "make clean ; make" should build m and run it on input 83.
   
Submit the Makefile as quiz/q1-files/Makefile.

2) What does the program print, and why?

      #include<stdio.h>
      int main(int argc, char * argv[]){
         printf("%d, %d\n", (int)(signed char) -1, (int)(unsigned char) -1) ;
         printf("%d, %d\n", (int)(signed char) 255, (int)(unsigned char) 255) ;
         return 0 ; 
      }
      
It prints:
-1, 255
-1, 255

char types can be signed or unsigned (they also can be left with out specifying whether
it is signed or unsigned, see H&S). 

In all instances, the C compiler and runtime carries over the value of the character
into the char. In the case of an unsigned char of value -1, this is interpreted as 255.

And conversely, when the value 255 is considered as a signed char, its value is 
interpreted as -1.

Under 2's complement representantion, an unsigned value is placed as the rightmost 
bytes of the widened location (from char to int) and the unoccupied bits are set to 0.

Under 2's complement representantion, a signed value is placed as the rightmost 
bytes of the widened location (from char to int) and the unoccupied bits are set to
the bit value of the most significant bit, a process called sign bit extension.

Note that! in an 8 bit char, -1 is NOT 0x81, (0b10000001). This is called sign-magnitude
and is not commonly used. Two's complement represents -1 as the complement of 0x01, or 0xfe, 
followed by an increment by one, 0xfe -> 0xff. The "all ones" is the correct bit pattern
for -1 in two's complement representation.
