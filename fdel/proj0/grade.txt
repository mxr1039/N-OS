  line 67: 	count_to = atoi(*argv) ;
  how do you know *argv exists? 
  if (argc!=1) { /* print usage and exit */ return 0; } // needed
  
  these lines:
  
  	    if ( j + n > counting_up) {
      	      j = counting_up;
	    }
	      
	    if ( j == counting_up) {
	      
	      printf("Boom!\n");
	    }
	    
	can be compressed to:
	
		if ( (j+n) >= counting_up ) { printf("Boom!\n") ; }
