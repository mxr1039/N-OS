* Copy this file to your own quiz folder. 
* Do not modify anything in the quiz folder, else subversion will stop your commits! 
* Put your name where it says "Name".


The three files m.c, s.c and s.h have been provided for you in a subdirectory
called q1-files. 

1) Write a Makefile with these targets:

   * m -     This target creates executable m from sources m.c, s.h and compiled s.o.
             It builds s.o if necessary.
   * s.o -   This target creates compiled s.o from sources s.c and s.h.
   * run -   This target runs ./m 83. It builds m if necessary.
   * clean - This target rm's all build products.

Target run is the default target.

All dependencies must work. For instance:

   * "touch s.o" should rebuild m on either make m or make run.
   * "touch s.c" should rebuild s.o and m on any of - make m, make s.o or make run.
   * "make clean ; make" should build m and run it on input 83.
   
Submit the Makefile as quiz/q1-files/Makefile.

2) What does the program print, and why?

      #include<stdio.h>
      int main(int argc, char * argv[]){
         printf("%d, %d\n", (int)(signed char) -1, (int)(unsigned char) -1) ;
         printf("%d, %d\n", (int)(signed char) 255, (int)(unsigned char) 255) ;
         return 0 ; 
      }
      
Signed characters prints negative numbers and positive numbers, and goes from -128 to 127. This is why the first -1 is print out correctly.

Unsigned characters go from 0 to 255 and this is why the unsigned 255 prints out correctly.

As for the signed 255 and unsigned -1, which both fall out of range, are converted to the equivalent two's complement. The two's complement of signed -1 and unsigned 255 (not how now they are in the appropiate range, is identical. This is why they are printed out in a sort of inverse way in the program.)
