	Read sections 3 and 4.


1) The Unix systems calls try to eliminate differences between styles of accesing
   I/O devices. What two major styles of access are mentioned?
   
   Two major styles are the sequential and the random access.

2) In the Unix system as described, what is the only exception to the rule of identical
   treatment for files on different file systems?

   You can't have a link between two file system hierarchies.

3) What are the three major categories of data in a file system (according to the
   presentation in class)?

   There is the metadata, superblock, and lastly the content.
   
4) What are the three kinds of files in the unix filesystem as described in the paper?

   Regular files, directory files, and then special files comprise the 3 categories.

5) Draw three distinctions that have practical effect between the unix filesystem
   and FAT.

   FAT has the 11 bit (8+3) file system names, which is why we need the unix_filenane and dos_filename function for minifat.c. Unix has 14.

   Unix superblock has security measures that the FAT table doesn't.

   Unix is case sensitive where as FAT isn't.
   
6) What are the two pieces of information in the file identifier in the NTFS filesystem?

   There is a number of blocks and then the logical block number which helps identify.

7) When does the unix filesystem reclaim the disk blocks of a file?

   It happens when you delete the last copy of the directory entry of a file. The link-count decreases to 0.
